# JavaScript/TypeScript Client SDK for OpenIM 👨‍💻💬

Use this SDK to add instant messaging capabilities to your application. By connecting to a self-hosted [OpenIM](https://www.openim.online/) server, you can quickly integrate instant messaging capabilities into your app with just a few lines of code.

The underlying SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) support provided by Go language, it can be compiled into wasm for web integration. The web interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, JavaScript handles the logic of the SQL layer by virtualizing SQLite and storing it in IndexedDB using [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/).

## Documentation 📚

Visit [https://docs.openim.io/](https://docs.openim.io/) for detailed documentation and guides.

For the SDK reference, see [https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/browser](https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/browser).

## Installation 💻

### Adding Dependencies

```shell
npm install @openim/wasm-client-sdk --save
```

### Obtaining Required Static Resources for WASM

Follow these steps to obtain the static resources required for WebAssembly (WASM):

1. Locate the `@openim/wasm-client-sdk` subdirectory in the `node_modules` directory of your project. Copy all the files in the `assets` folder to your project's public resource directory.

   The files to be copied are:

   - `openIM.wasm`
   - `sql-wasm.wasm`
   - `wasm_exec.js`

2. After copying the files, import the `wasm_exec.js` file in your `index.html` file using a `<script>` tag.

### Possible Issues ❗

## Usage 🚀

The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK. TypeScript is used, providing complete type hints.

### Importing the SDK

```typescript
import { getSDK } from '@openim/wasm-client-sdk';

const OpenIM = getSDK();
```

### Logging In and Listening for Connection Status

> Note: You need to [deploy](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server#rocket-quick-start) OpenIM Server first, the default port of OpenIM Server is 10001, 10002.

```typescript
import { CbEvents } from '@openim/wasm-client-sdk';
import type { WSEvent } from '@openim/wasm-client-sdk/lib/types/entity';

OpenIM.on(CbEvents.OnConnecting, handleConnecting);
OpenIM.on(CbEvents.OnConnectFailed, handleConnectFailed);
OpenIM.on(CbEvents.OnConnectSuccess, handleConnectSuccess);

OpenIM.login({
  userID: 'IM user ID',
  token: 'IM user token',
  platformID: 5,
  apiAddr: 'http://your-server-ip:10002',
  wsAddr: 'ws://your-server-ip:10001',
});

function handleConnecting() {
  // Connecting...
}

function handleConnectFailed({ errCode, errMsg }: WSEvent) {
  // Connection failed ❌
  console.log(errCode, errMsg);
}

function handleConnectSuccess() {
  // Connection successful ✅
}
```

To log into the IM server, you need to create an account and obtain a user ID and token. Refer to the [access token documentation](https://docs.openim.io/restapi/userManagement/userRegister) for details.

### Receiving and Sending Messages 💬

OpenIM makes it easy to send and receive messages. By default, there is no restriction on having a friend relationship to send messages (although you can configure other policies on the server). If you know the user ID of the recipient, you can conveniently send a message to them.

```typescript
import { CbEvents } from '@openim/wasm-client-sdk';
import type {
  WSEvent,
  MessageItem,
} from '@openim/wasm-client-sdk/lib/types/entity';

// Listenfor new messages 📩
OpenIM.on(CbEvents.OnRecvNewMessages, handleNewMessages);

const message = (await OpenIM.createTextMessage('hello openim')).data;

OpenIM.sendMessage({
  recvID: 'recipient user ID',
  groupID: '',
  message,
})
  .then(() => {
    // Message sent successfully ✉️
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // Failed to send message ❌
    console.log(err);
  });

function handleNewMessages({ data }: WSEvent<MessageItem[]>) {
  // New message list 📨
  console.log(data);
}
```
